It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of `XMAS` - you need to find all of them.

    "Thinking of it as a two dimensional array, but stored as a single array with the entries being \"rows\" and the strings themselves representing columns, we can utilize the knowledge that a word search (at least this one) is a square. That means if we want to know the letter below a letter, we can go to the next \"row\" and look at the same \"column\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, finding things in diagonal directions is simply a factor of addition or subtraction by multiples of the number of rows we progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, check out of boundaries to ensure we don't go outside the \"square\". As an optimization, the algorithm can be improved by ignoring the top and bottom 4 rows for progressing up and down and the first and last 4 columns for progressing left and right respective."

    "* The recursive check always goes 1 more iteration past what it needs to find, and if that is on an out of bounds location, it wouldn't get counted. I could have just checked for `S` directly on the last one to return true immediately, but for sake of completion, I just moved the position check prior to the out of bounds check and that resolved the issue."
